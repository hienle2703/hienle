**Hi there** 👋

**Welcome to my humble profile** 🤔 

I am a Mobile Developer (mostly React Native) from Viet Nam. I am interested in, writing about and developing software solutions for mobile platforms and with TypeScript, React Native, ... at the moment. And I'm expanding my skills in Backend development with ExpressJS and MongoDB.
From being curious about Web development to .NET C# and now I am focusing to React Native. I was starting to love React Native along with its interesting logic & mindset, beautiful interface, and fast development... so I decided to spend a lot of time working with React Native.

I have experience in React Native, and Flutter in Social Networks, E-Commerce, and Insurance domains.
