**Hi there** 👋

**Welcome to my humble profile** 🤔 

I am a React Native Fresher from Viet Nam. I am interested in, write about and develop software solutions for and with JavaScript, React Native, Firebase,... at the moment.
From being curious with Web development to .NET C# and now I am focusing to React Native. I was starting to love React Native along with interesting animation, beatiful interface,... so I decided to spend a lot of time on learning React Native.
