**Hi there** 👋

**Welcome to my humble profile** 🤔 

I am a Mobile Developer (mostly React Native) from Viet Nam. I am interested in, write about and develop software solutions for mobile platforms and with TypeScript, React Native, ... at the moment. And I'm expanding my skills in Backend development with ExpressJS and MongoDB.
From being curious with Web development to .NET C# and now I am focusing to React Native. I was starting to love React Native along with interesting logics & mindset, beatiful interface, fast development... so I decided to spend a lot of time on working with React Native.
